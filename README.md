# French_WLC_budgets

Repository to store the files associated with the calculation of operational and embodied greenhouse gases emissions (GHGE) of the French building stock for 2019 (reference year), along with different decarbonisation pathways designed to represent whole-life carbon (WLC) budgets by 2050.

### Operational GHGE calculation

National energy balance is given by the SDES @ (https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/bilan-energetique-de-la-france-pour-2021)
The detail of electricity by usage is given by RTE @ (https://rte-futursenergetiques2050.com/)
Base Carbone is given by ADEME @ (https://base-empreinte.ademe.fr/)


### Embodied GHGE calculation

Exiobase needs to be downloaded externally @ (https://zenodo.org/record/5589597).


### SNBC scenario

More information on the Low-Carbon National Strategy (SNBC) is available from the French government @ (https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/strategie-nationale-bas-carbone-snbc), including an English version @ (https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/en_SNBC-2_complete.pdf)
